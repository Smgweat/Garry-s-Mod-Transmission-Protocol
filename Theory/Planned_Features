The following are features to be added or that are currently being worked on.

1.  Packet division,
      Dividing large payloads into manageable and transferrable packets.
      
2.  TCP / UDP style protocol,
      Allowing packets to be sent unconfirmed, or require confirmation.
      
3.  Encryption,
      Either for use of checksums to prevent data corruption or to avoid MITM-Attack capability.
      
4.  Routing,
      Using seperate systems to direct data could be potentially handle more bandwidth than an Address / Lockout system.
      
5.  Data Compression,
      Reducing large ammounts of data to the minimum possible space before transmission. Eg; 4 Characters to 1 Word.
